Description: Calculates total survey error (TSE) for a survey under multiple, different weighting schemes, using both scale-dependent and scale-independent metrics.  Package works directly from the data set, with no hand calculations required: just upload a properly structured data set (see TESTWGT and its documentation), properly input column names (see functions documentation), and run your functions.  For more on TSE, see: Weisberg, Herbert (2005, ISBN:0-226-89128-3); Biemer, Paul (2010) <doi:10.1093/poq/nfq058>; Biemer, Paul et.al. (2017, ISBN:9781119041672); etc.
Note: 'TSEwgt' is a companion package to 'TSE'. Each package calculates
        TSE, but the former for multiple, different surveys, and the
        latter for a single survey under multiple, different weighting
        schemes.
